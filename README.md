# bitcoin address labelling

Work Flow:

### insert bitcoin data into dgraph

[Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/) is a distributed based graph database. At first, we load bitcoin transaction data into dgraph. Code is available at `create_dgraph_network.py`

You can use `GraphQL+-`, a graph query language based on Facebookâ€™s GraphQL, to do visualization of addresses' relationship. Code attached below is a simple demo to search related addresses in the nearest 4 layers.  

```mysql
{
  everyone(func: eq(address, "13uHBf49DjimMpEkaSEshpcKipFDmem2Cr")) {
    uid
    address
    transfer{ 
      uid
      address 
      transfer {
        address 
        transfer (first: 50){
          address
        }
      }
    	
    }
  }
}

```

The visualization result is:

### search address relationship in the graph database

Using raw data that already labelled the ownership of public bitcoin address, given any bitcoin address, we can see which addresses have relationship with target address.
